# D2MPQ (Diablo II: LOD) * MPQ Protection* 
This little trick is replacing some bytes in the .MPQ's and Storm.dll for the Diablo II: LOD 1.13c client.
You can also change these offsets for a newer or older client as well.
 
This will prevent someone from just plainly opening and browsing your .MPQ files.
Just simply drag and drop into the executable itself. You will have to-do **each** .MPQ file one-by-one. Lastly, your Storm.dll. Done.
